#0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
#Overview
In this project, you will learn about type annotations in Python 3 and how to use them to specify function signatures and variable types. The project also demonstrates duck typing, a flexible programming style, and how you can use MyPy to validate code type correctness.

#Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand type annotations in Python 3 and their syntax.
Use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.
Explain the concept of duck typing and its implications for dynamic languages like Python.
Validate code type correctness using MyPy, identifying mismatches between expected and actual types.
#Project Requirements
This project is developed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.7.
The code follows the pycodestyle (version 2.5) style guide.
All files should be executable and end with a newline.
Each file should start with #!/usr/bin/env python3.
Each module, class, and function should have comprehensive documentation in the form of docstrings.
The length of your files will be tested using the wc command.
Editors such as vi, vim, and emacs are permitted for code development.
Thank you for reading this README. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please open an issue on this repository. Happy coding!
